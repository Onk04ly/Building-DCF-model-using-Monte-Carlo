# Building DCF model using Monte-Carlo. 

Created Complete Python tool for performing Monte-Carlo Simulations on Discounted Cash flow valuations. This grade tool is designed for financial analyst, investment professionals and anyone requiring valuation analysis. 

🚀 Features

Phase 1: Core DCF Engine
It can easily able to calculate the intrinic value using projected cash flows.
Customizable discount rates and terminal growth rates.
Thorough Validation and Error checking. 

Phase 2: Monte Carlo Simulation

It Supports normal, triangular, as well as uniform distributions
It can easily able to Run 10,000+ simulations efficiently

Phase 3: Visualization & Analysis

Histograms, density curves, and probability plots
VaR analysis, confidence intervals, and downside risk assessment
Parameter sensitivity and two-way sensitivity heatmaps
Summary reports for decision-makers
Multi-company comparison tools
Scenario analysis for extreme market conditions
